Numbers Into Notes
==================

Interactive JavaScript demo for the Ada Lovelace Symposium held in Oxford in December 2015, in which number sequences are converted into notes.

Originally designed as a standalone demo to run on a laptop attached to a large display, this software is now also available online. It has been developed and tested in Chrome on a Mac, and also tested in Firefox (and it runs on chrome on android but is not designed to be without a mouse).

The three main modes of running this single page web application are described below.

1. Online on the Web
--------------------

Normal use. The URL to the current test server is

http://demeter.oerc.ox.ac.uk/NumbersIntoNotes/

and this provides full interactive functionality (the interactive HTML/Javascript document) plus notation, MIDI file generation, and provenance graph generation (via CGI).

NB Once you have loaded and run NumbersIntoNotes online it will continue to run in your browser offline, but the notation, MIDI, and provenance buttons in the export section will disappear (also avoid clicking on links in the text to wikipedia, oeis etc).  Audio will continue to work as long as the soundfonts have been cached.  Saving the page from the browser in Chrome will provide a local version that runs fresh but you will lose the fonts as these are not saved (so some buttons lose their labels).

2. Download the zip file
------------------------

To preload a backup onto a laptop for talks (or obtain a copy to edit as you wish). Download and unzip NiN.zip then click on NumbersIntoNotes.html

http://demeter.oerc.ox.ac.uk/NumbersIntoNotes/NiN.zip

The notation and MIDI buttons will not appear.  Run it online to load the soundfonts.  The benefit of this version is you know you have it preloaded and can demo independent of access to the server.

3. Standalone using a local web server on your laptop
-----------------------------------------------------

This can provide full functionality without being online but requires advanced setup. Download the distribution from github and install it to be served from your host. This will immediately run as with the zip file above but from localhost; e.g.

http://localhost/~dave/NumbersIntoNotes.html

There are four optional steps for additional functionality:

1. Edit the NumbersIntoNotes.js file to load the sound fonts locally from the sf directory (search for Soundfont).  You can then run offline.

2. For notation support, install Lilypond on your machine ( http://www.lilypond.org/ ), create a pdf directory (where PDFs and logs will be kept), and install the cgi-bin/lily script according to your server configuration, editing the hard paths in the script accordingly. Also edit the POST action in NumbersIntoNotes.html to call your CGI script.

3. For MIDI support, install midicsv on your machine ( http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/ ), create a midi directory on the server (where MIDI files and logs will be kept), and install the cgi-bin/csvmidi script according to your server configuration, editing the hard paths in the script accordingly. Also edit the POST action in NumbersIntoNotes.html to call your CGI script.

4. For PROV support, install provconvert on your machine ( https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/wiki/provconvert ), create a prove directory on the server (where prov-n files and logs will be kept), and install the cgi-bin/prov script according to your server configuration, editing the hard paths in the script accordingly. Also edit the POST action in NumbersIntoNotes.html to call your CGI script.

Written by David De Roure, December 2015, for the Ada Lovelace Symposium and as an interactive demonstration to encourage discussion about music, mathematics, and programming at the time of Ada Lovelace. Thanks to *Emily Howard* and *Lasse Rempe-Gillen* for their inspiration through Ada sketches, to Pip Willcox for jointly organising the Numbers into Notes project, and to all our colleagues for feedback and ideas.
